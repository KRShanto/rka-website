# RKAD website

This website is basically a clone and modified version of my another project `https://bwkd.org`.

In the previous project, we were using Supabase for handling everything.

So here we will be using:

- Next.js 15
- Uploadthing
- Prisma with Postgres
- Custom JWT authentication

Most of the UI is done already. We need to change the backend mostly.
